GenePainter v.2.0 maps gene structures onto multiple sequence alignments
Contact: Martin Kollmar (mako[at]nmr.mpibpc.mpg.de)


INTRODUCTION
------------
The conservation of intron positions comprises information useful for de novo gene prediction as well as for analyzing the origin of introns. Here, we present GenePainter, a standalone tool for mapping gene structures onto pr
otein multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Gene structures, as provided by WebScipio, are aligned with respect to the exact positions of the introns (down to nucleotide level) and intron phase. Output can be viewed in various 
formats, ranging from plain text to graphical output formats.


INSTALLATION
------------

Unpack
------
Use one of the following methods, depending on the type of your archive file:
$ unzip gene_painter.zip
$ tar -xzf gene_painter.tgz


Compilation
-----------
No compilation required.


Ruby version
------------
Ruby version 2.0.0 or higher is required. If necessary, consider using Ruby Version Manager (RVM; https://rvm.io/) to install and work with multiple ruby environments on your machine. 


RUNNING GENEPAINTER
-------------------

Ruby interpreter
----------------
Invoke GenePainter via one of the following options:

1) as a script
$ ruby gene_painter.rb

2) as a program
$ ./gene_painter.rb

Usage
-----
Usage: gene_painter.rb -i path_to_alignment -p path_to_genestructure_folder [options]
Standard output format: Mark exons by '-' and introns by '|'

    -i, --input <path_to_alignment>  Path to fasta-formatted multiple sequence alignment
    -p <path_to_genestructures>,     Path to folder containing gene structures in YAML or GFF format
        --path

Options
-------
Text-based output format:
        --intron-phase               Mark introns by their phase instead of '|'
        --phylo                      Mark exons by '0' and introns by '1'
        --spaces                     Mark exons by space (' ') instead of '-'
        --no-standard-output         Specify to skip standard output format.
        --alignment                  Output the alignment file with additional lines containing intron phases
        --fuzzy N                    Introns at most N base pairs apart from each other are aligned

Graphical output format:
        --svg                        Drawn a graphical representation of genes in SVG format
                                     Per default, detailed representation will be produced
                                     Use parameter '--svg-format' to get less details
        --svg-format FORMAT          FORMAT: ["normal", "reduced", "both"]
                                     'normal' draws details of aligned exons and introns [default]
                                     'reduced' focuses on common introns only
                                     'both' draws both formats

        --pdb FILE                   Mark consensus or merged gene structure in pdb FILE
                                     Consenus gene structure contains introns conserved in N % of all genes
                                     Specify N with option --consensus N; [default: 80%]
                                     Two scripts for execution in PyMol are provided:
